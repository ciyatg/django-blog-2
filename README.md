# django-blog-2

Basically what I will do here is to add some functionalities to the blog I created in my django-blog repository. 
The first versions of the files in this repository are the last version of the files in my django-blog repository. 

With i_was_here app I wanted to create a page where people could add and post their name to show that they visited my blog. 
But when I look at the files I created for this app I see that I screwed it up.
In order to add this functionality to my blog, I will follow Djangogirls's tutorial. This tutorial teachs how to create a blog to post some texts.
That is why I think that these tutorials can help me to build the i_was_here app.
