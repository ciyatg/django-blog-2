{% extends "personal/header.html" %} 

{% block content %} <!–– jinja logic ––>

Extend is not always proper to use. For example one could have a conflict if 
two different included HTMLs have body extensions.
 Another way of using secondary HTMLs is "include" 
 ––>
{% include 'personal/includes/htmlsnippet.html' %}
 
{% endblock %}
